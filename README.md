# SortingAlgorithmGUI
A GUI that allows a user to select what type of sorting algorithm to visualize (IN PROGRESS)

This version will only display the algorithm windows separately from the main GUI...
Another version of this same program will run the animations in the same initial GUI frame, but having multiple animations to run has proven difficult to manage. For now the animations have been segmented until I can resolve the issue.
